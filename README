This is a small executable packer that I have been working on and off for some time. 
There is some bugs:

Known bugs:
* Incompatibility with shared.dll of foobar2000.
* No load config directory support.

mupack3 is developed in private and is designed to fix these issues and many others, so don't expect a public release at all.
Virus scanners now scan for mupack2, making it somewhat useless now (thanks to leakers from Exetools).

Source code might be useful for people who want to read how to develop a packer in mostly C though.
